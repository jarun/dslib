# dslib
`dslib` is a library of cohesive data structures. The goal of `dslib` is to demonstrate how complex data structures (and related algorithms) can be developed by reusing simpler ones. In general, textbooks come with numerous unrelated examples, each relevant to a specific data structure. `dslib`, on the other hand, grows by building on the elementary data structures.

The core component is a circular doubly linked list. Library-internal data structures are dynamically (de)allocated.

Most of the code conforms to the Linux kernel coding standards (verified against *checkpatch.pl*), other than a few unavoidable instances.

`dslib` is an academic library. However, we'll be glad if someone finds any other application of it.

### Building blocks
| DS | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dlist | Circular doubly linked list. Node has next, prev and data (`void *`, caller (de)allocates) pointers. |
| queue | Builds on top of dlist. Each element is a dlist node pointing to the value inserted in the queue. |
| stack | Builds on top of dlist. Each element is a dlist node pointing to the value pushed in the stack. |
| tree | A binary search tree, stores integers. |
| AVL | An AVL tree implementation, stores integers. |
| BFS | Iterative Breadth-first search for tree and AVL implemented using the queue. |
| DFS | Iterative Depth-first search for tree implemented using the stack. |

There are test cases for each DS. Though not very organized, they provide an insight into the usage of `dslib`.

### APIs
A complete list of APIs can be found in [apilist.txt](https://github.com/jarun/dslib/blob/master/apilist.txt). Most of the APIs are iterative.
The following 2 APIs are recursive and the iterative implementations are left as an exercise:

```
bool delete_tree_node(tree_pp head, int val);
bool delete_avl_node(avl_pp head, int val);
```

### Thread-safety
Currently the Thread-Safe mode is implemented only for AVL. The lock functions are in common.h and common.c and it's easy to extend thread-safety in other structures.

### Compilation
The following compilation steps are tested on Ubuntu 14.04.4 x86_64:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jarun/dslib/
    $ cd dslib
    $ make

To install `dslib`, run:

    $ sudo make install

To remove `dslib` from your system, run:

    $ sudo make uninstall

Clean up (cleans test executables too):

    $ make clean

### Testing
Make sure `dslib` is installed. To compile test cases under `test` subdirectory:

    $ sudo make install
    $ make test

Only informative logs are enabled. For DEBUG logs, set:

    int current_log_level = DEBUG;

in the source test file.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! We would love to see more data structures and APIs added to `dslib`.
